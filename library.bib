year="2015",

pages="133--149",
abstract="In this paper, the problem of safe exploration in the active learning context is considered. Safe exploration is especially important for data sampling from technical and industrial systems, e.g. combustion engines and gas turbines, where critical and unsafe measurements need to be avoided. The objective is to learn data-based regression models from such technical systems using a limited budget of measured, i.e. labelled, points while ensuring that critical regions of the considered systems are avoided during measurements. We propose an approach for learning such models and exploring new data regions based on Gaussian processes (GP's). In particular, we employ a problem specific GP classifier to identify safe and unsafe regions, while using a differential entropy criterion for exploring relevant data regions. A theoretical analysis is shown for the proposed algorithm, where we provide an upper bound for the probability of failure. To demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our safe exploration scheme in the active learning setting, we test the approach on a policy exploration task for the inverse pendulum hold up problem."

Such uncertainties can arise from unmodeled non-linearities or external disturbances, for example. By explicitly considering the state dependency of the uncertainty sets in the RMPC approach, it is shown how closed-loop performance can be improved over existing approaches that consider worst-case uncertainty. Being able to handle state-dependent uncertainties is particularly relevant in learning-based MPC where the system model is learned from data and confidence in the model typically varies over the state space. The efficacy of the proposed approach for learning-based RMPC is illustrated with a numerical example, where uncertainty sets are obtained from data using Gaussian Process regression."

    abstract = {Legged robots pose one of the greatest challenges in robotics. Dynamic and agile maneuvers of animals cannot be imitated by existing methods that are crafted by humans. A compelling alternative is reinforcement learning, which requires minimal craftsmanship and promotes the natural evolution of a control policy. However, so far, reinforcement learning research for legged robots is mainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have been deployed on real systems. The primary reason is that training with real robots, particularly with dynamically balancing systems, is complicated and expensive. In the present work, we introduce a method for training a neural network policy in simulation and transferring it to a state-of-the-art legged system, thereby leveraging fast, automated, and cost-effective data generation schemes. The approach is applied to the ANYmal robot, a sophisticated medium-dog{\textendash}sized quadrupedal system. Using policies trained in simulation, the quadrupedal machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been achieved with prior methods: ANYmal is capable of precisely and energy-efficiently following high-level body velocity commands, running faster than before, and recovering from falling even in complex configurations.},

abstract = { ATRIAS is a human-scale 3D-capable bipedal robot designed to mechanically embody the spring-mass model for dynamic walking and running. To help bring the extensive work on this theoretical model further into practice, we present the design and validation of a spring-mass robot that can operate in real-world settings (i.e. off-tether and without planarizing restraints). We outline the mechanisms and design choices necessary to meet these specifications, particularly ATRIAS’ four-bar series-elastic leg design. We experimentally demonstrate the following robot capabilities, which are characteristics of the target model. 1) We present the robot’s physical capability for both grounded and aerial gaits, including planar walking and sustained hopping, while being more efficient than similarly gait-versatile bipeds. 2) The robot can be controlled by enforcing quantities derived from the simpler spring-mass model, such as leg angles and leg forces. 3) ATRIAS replicates the center-of-mass dynamics of human hopping and (novelly) walking, a key spring-mass model feature. Lastly, we present dynamically stable stepping in 3D without external support, demonstrating that this theoretical model has practical potential for real-world locomotion. }

    journal = {International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)},
    year = {2019},
    abstract = {Tensegrity robots, which are prototypical examples of hybrid soft-rigid robots, exhibit dynamical properties that provide ruggedness and adaptability. They also bring about, however, major challenges for locomotion control. Due to high dimensionality and the complex evolution of contact states, data-driven approaches are appropriate for producing viable feedback policies for tensegrities. Guided Policy Search (GPS), a sample-efficient hybrid framework for optimization and reinforcement learning, has previously been applied to generate periodic, axis-constrained locomotion by an icosahedral tensegrity on flat ground. Varying environments and tasks, however, create a need for more adaptive and general locomotion control that actively utilizes an expanded space of robot states. This implies significantly higher needs in terms of sample data and setup effort. This work mitigates such requirements by proposing a new GPS- based reinforcement learning pipeline, which exploits the vehicles high degree of symmetry and appropriately learns contextual behaviors that are sustainable without periodicity. Newly achieved capabilities include axially-unconstrained rolling, rough terrain traversal, and rough incline ascent. These tasks are evaluated for a small variety of key model parameters in simulation and tested on the NASA hardware prototype, SUPERball. Results confirm the utility of symmetry exploitation and the adaptability of the vehicle. They also shed light on numerous strengths and limitations of the GPS framework for policy design and transfer to real hybrid soft-rigid robots.},

doi = {10.1177/0278364914552112},
abstract = { One of the key topics in robotics is legged locomotion, taking inspiration from walking and bouncing gaits of bipeds and quadrupeds. A fundamental tool for analyzing running and hopping is the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), thanks to its simplicity but also effectiveness in modeling bouncing gaits. Being completely passive, the SLIP model does not have the ability to modify its net energy, which, for example, can be a prohibitive obstacle when traveling on a terrain with varying heights. The actuated version of the SLIP model, the active SLIP, considered in this paper, includes a series actuator that allows energy variations via compressing or extending the spring. In this work, we investigate how different actuator motions can affect the system’s state, and we propose a control strategy, based on graphical and numerical studies of the reachability space, and updated throughout the stance phase, to drive the system to a desired state. We quantify its performance benefits, particularly in serving as an error-recovering method. The objective of our control strategy is not to replace any leg-placement approach proposed by other works, but rather to be paired with any other leg-placement or path planning method. Its main advantage is the ability to reduce the effects of sensing errors and disturbances happening at landing as well as during the stance phase. }
