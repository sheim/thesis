The road to graduation is long and laborious, but never lonely.
It is the countless thought-provoking conversations I have had over the years that have made this choice in life worthwhile. Whether contemplating the woes of academia over a drink in the wee hours after a conference, discussing the latest results and planning next steps in the lab, or bouncing ideas back and forth over a ping-pong table, these conversations are what have led me to where I am, in research and in life. To each of you who have provoked my beliefs, stoked my imagination, tickled my thinking-box, thank you. I hope we meet again.
