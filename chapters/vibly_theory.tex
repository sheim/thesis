\chapter{Theory of Viability in State Action Space}
We introduce in this chapter the formal mathematics of extending the notion of viability theory to state-action space. We will cover

\section{Viable Sets in State Action Space}
Formal Definition, and an algorithm to compute based on the transition matrix
Conditions for a policy to be viable.
\section{Measures of Viability}
Introduce the measure, taken over the viable set, and of the whole set, or of a slice at a point of the state-space. Map this back into Q-space.

\section{Robustness to Uncertainty}
We can now formalize robustness to uncertainty in action space. This can be considered as a minimax or adversarial.
Point out relation to uncertainty in state space.
