\chapter{Published Work} \label{chap:pubs}
This cumulative thesis is based on the four first author, peer-reviewed publications I produced during my phd studies:

\section{Individual Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Training wheels
    \item Beyond Basins
    \item Safety Measure
    \item Unviable
\end{enumerate}
