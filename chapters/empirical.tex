\chapter{Shaping with Training Wheels}

Most shaping is done by focusing on $R$. There has been, to the best of our knowledge, only one study which formally explores the effect of changing $P$, isolated from changes in $R$. It is however, purely done in simulation. We explore this concept empirically for a hopper.

\subsection{Concept}
We have a hopper, with a parameterized oscillatory controller. We perform stochastic gradient descent to find controller parameters. Due to the low dimensionality, we can empirically map out the entire reward landscape quickly and reliably.
